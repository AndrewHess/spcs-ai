To submit, copy the `.ipynb` file to your own folder inside of `2-state-machines` and then add it to the repository.

You may have noticed `answers.py`. Ignore this for as long as you can! You will learn a lot more if you do the exercise completely on your own. If you absolutely get stuck, consult a peer or a TA; if you still can't make progress, only then consult the answers file. If you do, write yourself comments explaining exactly how and why the answer works!
