Individual assignment.

Write two state machine evaluators for word automata: one which takes a state machine representing a language along with a string, and checks whether the machine accepts the string; and another which takes such a state machine and generates strings from it. See the starter notebook for more information.

To submit, copy the `.ipynb` file and rename it `lastname.ipynb`.

You may have noticed `answers.py`. Ignore this for as long as you can! You will learn a lot more if you do the exercise completely on your own. If you absolutely get stuck, consult a peer or a TA; if you still can't make progress, only then consult the answers file. If you do, write yourself comments explaining exactly how and why the answer works!
