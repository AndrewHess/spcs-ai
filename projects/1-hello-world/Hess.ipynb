    "Hello, I am Andrew Hess. As far as programming goes, I took a introductory class during 9th grade, taught myself some java in 10th grade, and took the AP Computer Science A test in 11th grade. Through this course, I hope to learn about machine learning so I can implement it in some of the programs I have or will write. Aside from programming, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and playing the piano and guitar."
