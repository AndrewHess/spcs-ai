Individual assignment.

Pick an AI system, describe it briefly, and explain its "perspective." Who wrote
this system and for what purpose? Who uses the system---are their goals aligned
with those of the system authors? From a knowledge representation standpoint,
how does it view the world? Which concepts are central, and which concepts are
peripheral? How does this system interact with humans, and what does it know or
assume about the humans who use it? How could a hostile user or third party
subvert this system and break it or harrass/injure other users? Consult the
documentation of this system, or articles written about it, if necessary. Write
at least 300 words.

Enterprising students could write more, engaging with the subject more deeply; or
compare two or more different AI approaches to the same problem, with respect to
the criteria above.

Put your markdown (.md) text file in this folder---`lastname.md`.
